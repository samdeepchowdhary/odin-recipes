    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple,
      originated in England. It is often served with whipped cream, ice cream or
      cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and
      below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of
      crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to
      prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust
      only and tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on
      the bottom.

    <p>
      Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its
      signature comfort foods.
