    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple,
      originated in England. It is often served with whipped cream, ice cream or
      cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and
      below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of
      crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to
      prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust
      only and tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on
      the bottom.

      Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its
      signature comfort foods.
