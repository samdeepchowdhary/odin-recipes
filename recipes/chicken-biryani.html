    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian
      subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat usually that
      of chicken, goat, lamb, prawn, fish, and sometimes, in addition, eggs or
      vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.

    <p>
      This is often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings,
      parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but
      the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, always use long grain rice.
      Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. Ghee
      can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.
